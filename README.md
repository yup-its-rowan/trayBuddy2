# TrayBuddy :)

Hey everyone!
This is a little program I keep running to help automate tasks I do a lot. I started out with automating links that I opened frequently, but I ended up adding extraneous applications that I wanted to build and launch quickly.

Make sure to have the files "pass.txt" and "api.txt" in the /src/main/resources/ directory. These hold important keys that I did not keep in the repo for obvious reasons. 
You can create a .jar file using View -> Tool Windows -> Maven Projects On the startup of whatever computer you have, make sure to link to trayBuddy.bat in the /jarBuild directory. Keeps things modular and easy to change with updates to TrayBuddy.
