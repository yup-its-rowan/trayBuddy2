# TrayBuddy :)

Hey everyone!
This is a little program I keep running to help automate tasks I do a lot. I started out with plans to Plans to create a website that's controllable by this, and then connect hardware to the website. Hopefully given time I'll be able to make my own web of connected devices I control through this.

On the startup of whatever computer you have, make sure to link to trayBuddy.bat in the /jarBuild directory. Keeps things modular and easy to change with updates to traybuddy
